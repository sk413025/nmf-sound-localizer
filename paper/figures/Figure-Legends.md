**Fig. 1 | A passive acrylic plate exposes directional coding at one measurement point.**
a, Photograph of the experimental setup (loudspeaker excitation, acrylic sensor plate and laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV)).
b, Physical-principle schematic corresponding to Supplementary Methods 1. Changing input direction alters how the acrylic plate excites and combines structural modes, so one fixed LDV point records a different single-point spectral fingerprint even though the measurement location does not move.
c, Broadband spectral reshaping with repeatability under matched calibration. The flat white-noise source spectrum (grey dashed) is redistributed differently at five representative angles (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°); light traces show repeated calibration trials and bold traces show the angle-wise mean response.
d, Frequency-dependent directivity across 0°–180° for four frequency bands (0.3–0.5, 0.5–1, 1–2, 2–3 kHz). Different bands emphasize different directional sectors, showing that directional encoding is distributed unevenly across frequency.
e, Inter-angle fingerprint similarity matrix of the calibrated acrylic dictionary \(H\). The near-diagonal high-similarity band shows that nearby directions remain related without becoming interchangeable, providing the first direct evidence that the fingerprints trace a local geometry.

**Fig. 2 | The directional code is compact and locally ordered.**
a, Singular-value spectrum of the centered-magnitude fingerprint matrix. Energy accumulates rapidly across the 37-angle grid: six components capture 80.3% of the energy and eight capture 85.1%. Most measured directional structure therefore sits in a small component set.
b, Representative component spectra \(|u_r(f)|\) for components 1, 2, and 6. Together they show three reusable spectral patterns in the centered-magnitude decomposition.
c, Matching half-plane polar profiles \(v_r(\theta)\) for components 1, 2, and 6. They show how those same components vary across 0°-180°.
d, Local-ordering decay in centered-\(|H|\). Mean inter-angle correlation is plotted against angular separation for the acrylic reference object, showing a finite positive local neighborhood that decays toward a first nonpositive mean near 25°.
e, All-angle reconstruction fidelity under rank-\(r\) truncation. Per-angle centered-magnitude RMSE drops sharply in the same six-component regime highlighted in panel a, showing that the local code is captured early.
f, Two-dimensional spectral embedding of the positive centered-neighborhood graph derived from centered-\(|H|\). The measured angle trajectory stays curved and locally ordered rather than fragmenting into isolated clusters, so the finite neighborhood quantified in panel d remains coherent in a graph-based view.

**Fig. 3 | Speech preserves the code but broadens nearby-angle overlap.**
a, White-noise stimulus: violin plot of within-angle versus between-angle Pearson correlations (\(d = 2.83\), within \(\bar{r} = 1.000\)).
b, Speech stimulus: same analysis (\(d = 1.95\), within \(\bar{r} = 0.907\)); within-angle similarity exceeds between-angle similarity despite content variation.
c, Per-angle discriminability margin (within \(\bar{r}\) minus between \(\bar{r}\)) for white noise (\(\Delta \bar{r} = 0.28\)) and speech (\(\Delta \bar{r} = 0.11\)), shown with light bootstrap uncertainty bands; the speech margin is smaller but remains above zero at all angles.
d, Stage-0 greedy-choice diagnostic across angle for white noise and held-out speech, shown with light clip-level uncertainty bands. The diagnostic is strong on most white-noise fingerprints but drops to near chance across the calibrated grid for held-out speech clips.
e, Pairwise fingerprint-similarity map in split-triangle form: lower-left = white noise (near-identity), upper-right = speech (broader local overlap but retained angle ordering), with the diagonal masked to separate the two regimes.
f, Stage-0 greedy-choice diagnostic versus SNR. The white-noise curve (blue, clip-level standard error of the mean (SEM) shading) is recomputed on synthetic noisy white-noise datasets. The speech-plus-babble curve (orange, 5-seed mean \(\pm\) standard error of the mean (SEM) shading) comes from a separate five-seed sweep. Both curves decline monotonically as noise increases, so added noise extends the same local-overlap failure to lower SNR.

**Fig. 4 | Preserving the measured neighborhood keeps subtraction physically plausible.**
a, Architecture and physics correspondence. The measured local band in \(H\) is shown beside the staged broad-match, local-gate, and local-update profiles on the shared angle axis, defining the neighborhood that should be preserved before subtraction.
b, Broad initial match for a representative 70° validation clip. Broad residual-to-dictionary matching excites several nearby calibrated angles above the measured local band in \(H\).
c, Local gate convergence for the same representative clip. Learned local pooling contracts support around the correct neighborhood and keeps the resulting update confined there.
d, Residual purification. Left, relative residual norm across the guided steps for the representative clip. Right, validation-wide cumulative update mass within radius before and after one local step across 1,924 clips; the mass within 15° rises from 0.18 to 0.98. Nearly all correction therefore collapses into the physically plausible neighborhood before subtraction proceeds.
e, Clean-condition Top-1 comparison of four overlap-handling rules on the same fixed dictionary (individual seeds shown as dots; large markers and error bars indicate mean \(\pm\) s.e.m.). The displayed clean means are 0.98 for the guided solver, 0.58 for router-bypass, 0.44 for the OMP baseline, and 0.03 for dense routing. Preserving the local angle band is what keeps subtraction physically plausible.

**Fig. 5 | The admissible readout follows the measured neighborhood.**
a, Five-seed SNR sweep for the same four overlap-handling rules. The delayed-commitment rule degrades least as noise increases, consistent with preserving local overlap before subtraction.
b, Per-angle clean accuracy across the 37 measured angles. After light 3-angle smoothing, the delayed-commitment rule remains highest across most angles, whereas dense routing stays near chance across much of the grid; light shading shows \(\pm 1\) s.e.m. around the five-seed mean \(P(\mathrm{correct})\). The neighborhood therefore governs readout across the grid, not only in one average metric.
c, Clean confusion comparison (row-normalized) of the OMP baseline and guided solver. Guided decoding concentrates near the diagonal, whereas the OMP baseline shows broader off-diagonal fracture after early commitment.
d, Measured local structure in the calibrated fingerprint space. The near-diagonal band summarizes the physical neighborhood that nearby angles share.
e, Learned neighborhood-emphasis map from the guided solver on the same angle frame and correlation scale as panel d. The learned map keeps a similar coarse near-diagonal ordering instead of dispersing weight broadly across the grid.
f, Quantitative structure alignment. Top, normalized local-band summaries from the measured and learned maps across angle. Bottom, concordance scatter of the same per-angle scores. The learned map follows the same measured neighborhood identified by calibration: the full-matrix agreement reaches \(r = 0.47\), the per-angle summaries reach \(r = 0.46\), and the mean absolute gap is 0.23. Both correlations exceed the corresponding 95th-percentile permutation nulls (\(r = 0.41\) globally and \(r = 0.32\) for the local-band profile), so the alignment is stronger than shuffled angle structure would permit.

**Fig. 6 | A recurring directional code appears across ordinary passive objects.**
a, Measured response-regime map across the five target objects. Each object is placed by the zero crossing of its mean centered-\(|H|\) correlation-decay curve and by the effective rank of its centered-\(|H|\) matrix, so the panel summarizes response width and compactness without assigning unmeasured material constants.
b, Per-object template matrices \(H\). Shared-normalization heatmaps show structured angle-frequency encoding across the five objects; the colored horizontal band on each heatmap marks the object-specific frequency region that carries the strongest directional contrast.
c, Local-ordering decay across objects. Mean centered-\(|H|\) correlation is plotted against angular separation, with open markers denoting the first zero crossing for each object. Every object retains a finite neighborhood of positive local correlation, but the decay width differs across materials.
d, Object-conditioned readout versus overlap burden. Per-angle Top-1 distributions and object means exceed chance across the five objects. Object mean Top-1 is plotted against mean top-3 overlap burden, with marker area proportional to normalized overall \(|H|\) energy. Local separability, not response energy alone, is what orders the objects.
e, Selected bands and recovered directional codes. A shared contrast-selection rule identifies different informative frequency windows across objects, and the corresponding band-limited directional codes differ across those object-specific bands. The informative band changes from object to object, but the directional principle does not.
